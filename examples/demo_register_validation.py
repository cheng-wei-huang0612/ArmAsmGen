Register Type Validation Demo - ArmAsmGen Vector Operations

This demo shows how the vector ADD instructions validate register types
to prevent common mistakes like using scalar registers in vector operations.

Features demonstrated:
- Register type validation for vector operations
- Clear error messages for invalid register types
- Support for both Register objects and string register names
- Prevention of mixing scalar and vector registers

Usage:
