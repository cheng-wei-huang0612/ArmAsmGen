Demo: Wide multiplication using UMULH and SMULH
Demonstrates 128-bit × 128-bit → 256-bit multiplication using scalar high multiply instructions.

Theory:
For two 128-bit numbers A and B, each split into 64-bit halves:
    A = A_high << 64 + A_low
    B = B_high << 64 + B_low

The product A × B = (A_high << 64 + A_low) × (B_high << 64 + B_low)
                  = A_high × B_high << 128 + 
                    (A_high × B_low + A_low × B_high) << 64 + 
                    A_low × B_low

We need to compute four 64×64→128 bit multiplications and combine them.
